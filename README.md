## ⏳ What's next for Meebo?

We can use Pompy to help diagnose the user’s conditions in the future; asking users questions about their symptoms and their inner thoughts which they would otherwise be uncomfortable sharing can be more easily shared with a character like Pompy. While our team has set out for Pompy to be used in a Quarantine situation, we envision many other relevant use cases where Pompy will be able to better support one's companionship in hard times for factors such as anxiety and loneliness. Furthermore, we envisage the Pompy application being a resource hub for users to improve their overall wellness. Through providing valuable sleep hygiene, exercise tips and even lifestyle advice, Pompy will be the one-stop, holistic companion for users experiencing mental health difficulties to turn to as they take their steps towards recovery.

**we had to use separate github workspaces due to conflicts.
